## Project Title    

***Hello-World - My First Repository***

## Description      
This repository is a practice project to learn the basics of GitHub. By completing this, I learned how to:
- Create a new repository in GitHub.
- Write and format a README.md file using Markdown syntax.
- Understand how to document files and provide instructions for future users.  

The outcome of this project is a working “Hello World” program and a properly documented repository. While simple, this lays the foundation for managing larger, more complex projects in the future
